Note to self - I am now using an ML_DS folder that is not 
linked to OneDrive. I was having issues when removing files using Git 
Bash when the ML_DS (local repo) was linked to OneDrive where it was 
being removed from the OneDrive folder before I committed changes, thus 
causing a mismatch when I went to push changes. May need to bite the 
bullet and start a new repo from start just looking at the unlinked 
ML_DS folder.
